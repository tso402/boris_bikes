# boris_bikes
Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## Getting Started
`git clone git@github.com:tso402/debugging_wk1.git`

## Running Tests
rspec from project directory
